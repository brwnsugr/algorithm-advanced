/**
 * Amazon has multiple delivery centers and delivery warehouses all over the world!
 * The world is represented by a number line from -10^9 to 10^9. There are n delivery centers, the ith one at location center[i].
 * A location x is called a suitable location for a warehouse if it is possible to bring all the products to that point by traveling a distance of no more than d.
 * At any one time, products can be brought from one delivery center and placed at point x.
 * Given the positions of n delivery centers, calculate the number of suitable locations in the world.
 * That is, calculate the number of points x on the number line (- 10 ^ 9 <= x <= 10 ^ 9) where the travel distance required to bring all the products to that point is less than or equal to d.
 *
 * Note: The distance between point x and center[i] is x-center[i], their absolute difference.
 *
 * Example
 * Given n = 3, center = [-2, 1, 0], d = 8.
 *
 * The various locations along with the distance traveled to bring all treasures at that point are-
 * â€¢ Locate the warehouse at x=-3: First bring products from center[0] = -2 covering a distance of |-3-(-2)| = 1 to reach the center and |-3-(-2)|=1 to return. Similarly we bring products from centers 1 and 2 to point -3 for
 *
 * total distance of 1+1+4 +4 +3+3 = 16 which is > d. This is not a suitable location.
 *
 * Locate the warehouse at x = 0, total distance traveled is 2* |0-(-2)| +2* |0 -1|+2*|0-0| = 6 <=d. This is a suitable location.
 *
 * Locate the warehouse at x=-1, total distance traveled is 2* |-1-(-2)| +2* |-1-1| + 2*|-1-0| = 8 <=d. This is a suitable location.
 *
 * Locate the warehouse at x = 1, total distance traveled is 2* | 1-(-2)| +2* |1 - 1 |+ 2 * |1 - 0| = 8 <= dThis is a suitable location.
 *
 * The only suitable locations are (-1, 0, 1} Return 3.
 * Here the answer would be 3 because suitable locations are -1,0,1
 *
 * Example
 * Given n=4, center = 2,0,3,-4 and d =22
 * Answer would be 5 because the locations are -1,0,1,2,3
 *
 * Example
 * Given n=3 center = -3,2,2 and d=8
 * Answer would be 0
