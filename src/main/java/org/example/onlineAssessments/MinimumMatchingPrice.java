/**
 * There are n products being sold on a shopping app. The price of the ith product is price[i].
 * The developers decided to give special gift cards to innovative customers.
 * A gift card will be given if any customer buys a contiguous subsegment of products and at least 2 of the products have a matching price.
 * Find the minimum amount of money a customer needs to spend in order to get the gift card.
 * If it is not possible for any customer to get a gift card, return -1.
 *
 * Example:
 * price = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1]
 *
 * In the above example, the number of products n = 6. The subsegments where not all prices are distinct are (in increasing order of starting positions):
 *
 * Subsegment	Remarks	Total Cost
 * [1, 2, 3, 1]	1 has a matching price	7
 * [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]	1 and 2 have a matching price	9
 * [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1]	1 and 2 have a matching price	10
 * [2, 3, 1, 2]	2 has a matching price	8
 * [3, 1, 2, 1]	1 has a matching price	7
 * [1, 2, 1]	1 has a matching price	4
 * For all the other subsegments, all prices are distinct. The subsegment with the minimum price is from index 3 to 5 which costs 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Return 4.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * int price[n]: The prices of the products
 *
 * Returns:
 * int: The minimum amount of money to be spent or -1
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 5 Â· 105
 * 1 <= price[i] <= 106, 0 <= i <= n.
 * Other Cases:
 * Case 1:
 * price = [1, 2, 1, 2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The subsegments where not all prices are distinct are [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2] and [1, 2, 1, 2]. Of these, the minimum total price is 4.
 *
 * Case 2:
 * price = [1, 100, 1, 7, 7]
 * Output: 14
 * Explanation: The subsegments where not all prices are distinct are: [1, 100, 1], [7, 7] and [1, 100, 1, 7, 7].
